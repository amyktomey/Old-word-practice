C# project website... code Louisville

A work in progress, started as a javascript project monhts ago... I have removed all JS files, and am beginning the C# build.  If all goes as planned, this program will run on Windows and Mac systems.

This website is designed with my grandson in mind, who has dyslexia.  Using a mad libs format, this will allow ayone to learn the basic parts of speech in an enertaining way and practice spelling and readind by replacing various words of a story with a sp[ellking list or randomly selected words.  The idea is to provide several types of stories and different levels of difficulty.  Special fonts will be used to enhance learning for those with dyslexia, encouraging users to read their stories out loud.

The program will ask the user to input the words and plug them into the story BEFORE they have read it. 

The requests will be similar to:
  Please select a noun.  A noun is a person, place or thing.
  Please select a verb.  A verb is an action word.
  Please select a plural noun. This means more than one.
  Please select a proper noun. This is a name or title.

Level 1: Nouns and verbs. 8 selections.
Level 2: Add adjectives and adverbs, and requesting present or past tense.  16 selections.
level 3: Add interjections.  Ask for active or passive tense. 20 selections.

Stories might include: sports, summer vacation, pets, etc.

This is the goal.

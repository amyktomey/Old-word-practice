# FunWithWords
JS project website... code Louisville

This website is designed with my grandson in mind, who has dyslexia.  Using a mad libs format, this will allow ayone to learn the basic parts of speech in an enertaining way, by replacing various words of a story with randomly selected words.  The idea is to provide several types of stories and different levels of difficulty.  Special fonts will be used to enhance learning for those with dyslexia, encouraging users to read their own stories.

The program will ask the user to select random parts of speech... and plug them into the story BEFORE they have read it.

The requests will be similar to:
  Please select a noun.  A noun is a person, place or thing.
  Please select a verb.  A verb is an action word.
  Please select a plural noun. This means more than one.
  Please select a proper noun. This is a name or title.

Level 1: Nouns and verbs. 8 selections.
Level 2: Add adjectives and adverbs, and requesting present or past tense.  16 selections.
level 3: Add interjections.  Ask for active or passive tense. 20 selections.

Stories might include: sports, summer vacation, pets, etc.

This is the goal.
